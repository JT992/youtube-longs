# YouTube Longs
YouTube Shorts are terrible and the Shorts player on desktop is awful. However, Shorts can be opened and watched through the normal YouTube player, which I like more. I haven't seen a way to open the regular player from the Shorts player (probably because I didn't look), so I did this instead.

This works in Firefox, but I have no idea if it works anywhere else. It probably will, but you may have to tweak bits of it.

I have the code as a bookmark in the bookmarks bar. If you also want to do that:

1. Copy the TypeScript from the other file.
2. Add a bookmark (you can probably right-click the bookmarks bar)
3. In the URL field, type "`javascript:`" then paste in the TypeScript.

done. Now if you open up a YouTube Short, click the bookmark you just made and it *should* navigate to the the corresponding YouTube Long. If you try to click it anywhere else, it *should* do nothing.

(I don't think "YouTube Long" is the actual name. I do think it should be though.)
